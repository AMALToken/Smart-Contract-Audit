# Smart-Contract-Audit
Initial smart contract audit:
Auditing the token contracts listed on decentralized exchange is an important matter, so before starting the token trading on the decentralized exchange, an initial audit was conducted by three specialized companies to ensure that there were no security gaps or weak points in the codes, and that the smart contract could not be exploited from the harmful bots, in addition to removing the ineffective codes.
Final smart contract audit:
For maximum security, thirty days after AMAL was released for trading, we conducted a final audit of the smart contract before renouncing it ownership by one of the most important auditing companies in the world.
